h1. Fork

This a a "fork" of SecureSocial with the <a href="https://github.com/jaliss/securesocial/pull/493">PR #493<a> merged to the master-play-2.2.x branch.
To build it, you must install sbt and use the "publish" task in the "core" project (it also has the javaDemo and scalaDemo projects).
You can't use "play"/"activator" prompts to publish. It has to be the raw sbt command.
It is publishing the commits to a our own repository at bintray. You can change that also.
